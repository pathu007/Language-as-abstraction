# Language As an Abstraction for Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning

### Abstract:

One of the main reasons why humans have achieved such progress can
be attributed to our usage of language. Because communication is necessary to
transfer valuable information or data across multiple minds. Similar situation arises
with Deep Learning models, to solve the problem of abstractions and to make them
more in line with human understanding. Language as a tool has been used to allow
our deep learning agent to have some understanding of abstractions in words we can
understand, correct and communicate.
